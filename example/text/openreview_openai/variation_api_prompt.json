The attention map can be used to highlight useful information for disease classification and detection. The experiments show its improvements on different medical imaging tasks.  \nStrengths: \n--The idea using counterfactual images for saliency map generation is interesting.\n\n--The improvement for medical imaging taks is significant. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n--The novelty is simple and limited. \n\n--More experiments are needed, such as existing counterfactual generation.\nthe proposed method is interesting, but the novelty is limited\n\n\nArea: {area}\tRecommendation: {recommendation}.\nInput: {masked_sample}\nFill-in-Blanks and your answer MUST be exactly {word_count} words:"
